# Greenmat

**Greenmat** is a Ruby library for Markdown processing, based on [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet).

It's a core module of [qiita-markdown](https://github.com/increments/qiita-markdown) gem and not intended for direct use. If you are looking for Qiita-specified markdown processor, use qiita-markdown gem.

## Versioning Policy

Greenmat follows Redcarpet's updates by merging the upstream changes.
The version format is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.FORK`.
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is the same as the version of Redcarpet that Greenmat is based on. `FORK` is incremented on each release of Greenmat itself and reset to zero when any of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is bumped.

## Development

### Initial setup

Clone the Greenmat repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:increments/greenmat.git
$ cd greenmat
```

Set up git remote for Redcarpet as `upstream`:

```bash
$ rake greenmat:setup_upstream
```

### Merging upstream changes

Run the following task to merge `upstream/master` branch into the current branch:

```bash
$ rake greenmat:merge_upstream
```

Note that this task does _not_ automatically commit the merge, so you need to commit the changes after checking each diff. Also it forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by favoring upstream version.

If you want to merge a branch other than `upstream/master`, specify the name as `BRANCH` environment variable:

```bash
$ rake greenmat:merge_upstream BRANCH=branch_name
```

## Acknowledgment
